# Social Cafe iOS Sample App

Sample app for social cafe, counterpart to the web version: http://social-cafe.herokuapp.com/

Note: This sample uses story boards and only runs on iOS 5+.

Authors: Christine Abernathy (caabernathy)

## Installing

Installing the samples requires you to add the Facebook SDK, the Facebook SDK resource bundle, and the Facebook SDK deprecated headers for some samples. The missing required libraries and files will show up in red under the `Frameworks` folder when you open up the project. Simply delete those references then do the following:

* Add the Facebook SDK for iOS Framework by dragging the `FacebookSDK.framework` folder from the SDK installation folder into the Frameworks section of your Project Navigator.

* Choose 'Create groups for any added folders' and deselect 'Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)' to keep the reference to the SDK installation folder, rather than creating a copy.

* Add the Facebook SDK for iOS resource bundle by dragging the `FacebookSDKResources.bundle` file from the `FacebookSDK.framework/Resources` folder into the Frameworks section of your Project Navigator.

* As you did when copying the Framework, choose 'Create groups for any added folders' and deselect 'Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)'

* Build and run the project.
